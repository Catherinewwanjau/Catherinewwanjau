Current Focus:

* Migrating ML models TensorFLow to JAX
* Building strong portfolio in forecasting and anomaly detection
* Exploring opprtunities in data science and machine learning

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ... I'm continuously expanding my knowledge in data science, currently diving deeper into: Advanced Machine Learning Algorithms Model Optimization and Hyperparameter tuning Data engineering and Deployment

âš¡ Fun fact: ... I'm always up for a challenge and love trying new things, whether it's experimenting with the latest data science techniques or exploring new hobbies outside of tech!
